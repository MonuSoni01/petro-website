                    <h3>Early Beginnings
                    </h3>

                    <p class="intro-text">
                        When Nitesh Khurana was ten years old, he often spent his time sitting beside his father at a
                        small hardware shop in Rawla Mandi, a quiet village in the Sri Ganganagar district of Rajasthan.
                        The shop was modest in size, but it carried the weight of responsibility, hope, and hard work.

                    </p>

                    <p class="intro-text">
                        In 1992, his father, Rakesh Khurana, started the business completely from scratch and named it
                        Khurana Iron Store. There was no financial backing, no established network, and no
                        shortcuts—only discipline, honesty, and the belief that steady effort would eventually create
                        results.

                    <h2>
                        First Lessons from the Market
                    </h2>

                    <p>
                        For young Nitesh, the shop became his first school of business. He observed silently. Carpenters
                        regularly visited the shop and often shared their challenges. One problem came up again and
                        again. Even after completing expensive interior work, wall-mounted fittings would fall after
                        some time. The root cause was clear—there was no good-quality nylon sleeve or wall plug
                        available in the market.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To manage this, many carpenters fixed wooden blocks inside the wall and then inserted screws
                        into them. Initially, it worked. Over time, however, the wood dried, cracked, and loosened.
                        Fixtures fell, and carpenters felt deeply embarrassed in front of their clients. Their skills
                        and effort were questioned because of a small but critical product failure.

                    </p>
                    <p>Nitesh listened carefully. He did not realise then that these early observations would later
                        shape the foundation of his business journey.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Growing with Responsibility
                    </h2>
                    <p>In 1996, the family shifted the business to Sri Ganganagar city in search of better
                        opportunities. Once again, they began from the beginning. Wholesale supply started from home,
                        and Nitesh managed his studies alongside business responsibilities. He helped in dispatching
                        material, handling customers, and learning operations, all while continuing his education.</p>
                    <p>
                        He wished to pursue higher studies, but family conditions did not allow it. His father
                        encouraged him to stay focused on the business and often repeated a line that became deeply
                        rooted in Nitesh’s mind:
                    </p>
                    <p><b>One day, we will take this business to a high level.
                        </b></p>
                    <h2>Early Business Exposure</h2>
                    <p>In 1997, they opened a shop in the main market of Sri Ganganagar. Nitesh was in his tenth
                        standard. He attended to customers, managed dispatches, and studied whenever he found time. He
                        closely observed bigger traders and successful shop owners and quietly visualised himself
                        reaching that level one day. From a very young age, the desire to grow the business had taken
                        firm shape.</p>

                            Yet, the carpenter’s problem remained unsolved.

                    <h2>The Shift to Manufacturing
                    </h2>
                    <p>In 2003, the family made a bold decision to shift to Delhi. By then, they had experienced retail
                        and wholesale. Manufacturing was the next step. Delhi offered opportunities but also intense
                        competition. Once again, everything had to be built from scratch.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>This was the beginning of Petro Industries and the birth of the PETRO brand.
                        </b></p>
                    <h2>Identifying the Quality Gap
                    </h2>
                    <p>After moving to Delhi, Nitesh and his father conducted extensive market research. Surprisingly,
                        even in a large market like Delhi, they could not find a nylon sleeve that met their
                        expectations for strength and durability. Most products available were inconsistent and
                        unreliable.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>They decided to manufacture the product themselves.
                        </b></p>
                    <h2>Trials, Failures, and Persistence
                    </h2>
                    <p>They had no technical knowledge of mould-making or plastic raw materials. Learning happened
                        through experimentation. Several moulds failed. Large quantities of raw material were wasted.
                        Money was lost, and progress was slow. There was no proper technical guidance—only persistence
                        and patience.
                    </p>
                    <p>There were many difficult moments. Financial pressure increased, family stress grew, and
                        self-doubt appeared more than once. Yet, Nitesh never gave up. His faith remained strong, and he
                        believed that honest effort would eventually lead to success.</p>

                        A Breakthrough Product
                    </h2>
                    <p>After numerous trials and continuous improvement, a strong and reliable nylon sleeve was finally
                        developed. Before launching it commercially, they gave it to carpenters for testing. The
                        response was extremely positive. For the first time, carpenters felt confident that their work
                        would remain secure over time.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Building Market Reach
                    </h2>
                    <p>The next challenge was reach.</p>
                    <p>
                        Nitesh began travelling extensively, visiting different cities and hardware shops. Some dealers
                        supported the product immediately, while others rejected it. He accepted both with the same
                        mindset and continued moving forward.</p>
                    <p>
                        Soon, another issue surfaced. During transportation, packaging often gets damaged, leading to
                        losses and dissatisfaction among dealers. Instead of treating this as a minor problem, Nitesh
                        focused on solving it.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Packaging Innovation
                    </h2>
                    <p>In 2007, Petro Industries introduced a new packaging concept, which was among the first of its
                        kind in the Indian hardware market. This innovation improved product safety, presentation, and
                        dealer confidence.</p>
                    <p>Gradually, PETRO Nylon Sleeves reached every corner of India. Carpenters trusted the product.
                        Dealers and distributors benefited from consistent quality and healthy margins. The brand slowly
                        earned a reputation for reliability and trust.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Expanding into New Categories
                    </h2>
                    <p>In 2022, a long-standing dealer suggested expanding into unbreakable bath accessories, pointing
                        out that the market also lacked dependable quality in this segment. Before launching new
                        products, Nitesh took a critical strategic step.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Building a Strong Organisation</h2>
                    <p><b>In 2023, he incorporated the company as Petro Industech Private Limited.
                        </b></p>
                    <p>By this time, his thinking had evolved. He clearly understood that growth without systems creates
                        instability. As the business expanded, challenges appeared in billing, inventory control, sales
                        coordination, and marketing. Instead of reacting randomly, he focused on building structured
                        systems and a strong team.</p>
                    <p>In 2023, learning from his mentor gave him clarity and direction.
                    </p>
                    <p>By 2025, he fully recognised his role as a leader, not just an operator.</p>
                    <h2>Scaling with Structure
                    </h2>
                    <p>In the same year, a manufacturing unit was established in Bhiwadi, Rajasthan, marking a new phase
                        of planned and scalable growth.

                    </h2>
                    <p>Today, Nitesh Khurana stands as someone who has experienced every stage of the trade—from
                        retailer to wholesaler to manufacturer. He understands the daily realities faced by dealers and
                        distributors because he has lived them himself.

                    </h2>
                    <p>His mission is simple and firm:
                    </p>
                    <p><b>No dealer or distributor associated with PETRO should face the problems they once faced.
                        </b></p>
                    <p>Petro Industech is not only about selling hardware and bath accessories. It is about building
                        systems that help partners grow their businesses—two times, five times, even ten times—through
                        stability, support, and shared progress.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Continuing the Journey
                    </h2>
                    <p>This journey began with a small shop and big challenges.
                        It continues with leadership, structure, and responsibility.</p>
